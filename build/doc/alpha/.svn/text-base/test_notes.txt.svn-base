Notes to testers:

Although this is a backward compatible update of the ks0108  GLCD library, it has been significantly
improved and much of the low level infrastructure has been replaced with code
that is higher performance and is more flexible.  This was made possible through the expertise
of Bill Perry who did the lions share of work on the new code.

Things to test for:

1. Do the example sketches compile and function as expected in your environment?
2. If you have code written for the previous ks0108 library, does it run with this release?
   (see section on migrating code in the supplied documentation)
3. Is the supported functionally adequate and do things work as expected
4. Is the documentation clear and correct 
   (feel free to add comments or make changes in the Word document included in the glcd/doc directory)

Your feedback is appreciated, when reporting issues, please say what OS and Arduino version you were testing.

Note:
While there is documenation in html form which can be brought up by
clicking on glcd/doc/GLCDref.htm , it is very much in flux in terms of its
look and feel and is also incomplete.
As such, we really are not yet looking for detailed comments on the HTML version
of the documenation other than perhaps very general comments.
