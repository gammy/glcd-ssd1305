/*
 * glcd_Config.h - User specific configuration for Arduino GLCD library
 *
 * This file is shipped to automatically configure the library for a 
 * 128x64 ks0108 panel using the wiring described in the documentation.
 *
 * Use this file to select the active glcd configuration file
 * Then edit the selected panel file to configure parameters for that panel.
 *
 * This wiring is identical to the wiring used in the previous ks0108 library.
 * For Teensy devices the wiring selected matches the wiring documented on the Teensy website.

 /*
  * You can select a configuration file by uncommenting one line to include the
  * the desired configuration file.
  *
  * Select 1 and only 1 configuration file.
  *
  * The "AutoConfig" configuration files will configure the library based on a set of
  * pre-customized configurations for the supported Arduino board type. 
  *
  * These configurations match the the panel configurations and wiring diagrams
  * in the library documentation based on the type of board selected in the Arduino IDE
  * and are compatible with wiring used in earlier versions of the ks0108 library
  *
  * NOTE: if you have a panel that has different dimensions than the distributed configuration, you can either
  * edit the supplied configuration file for that board type or create a fully custom configuration file.
  *
  * The auto configuration file (default is named  "config/ks0108_Panel.h") selects the appropriate board
  * pin configuration file based on the current board selection in the Arduino IDE.
  *   
  * The auto configuration panel configuration files can be found in the "config" directory, the naming is:
  *  "{PANELNAME}_Panel.h"
  * Where:
  *   {PANELNAME} is the glcd panel type. (for example, ks0108)
  *
  * The pin configuration files for each board type can also be found in the "config" directory, the naming is:
  *  "{PANELNAME}_{BOARDNAME}.h"
  * Where:
  *   {PANELNAME} is the glcd panel type. (for example, ks0108)
  *   {BOARDNAME} is the name of the board (as selected in the Arduino IDE).
  *
  * So for example, the auto configuration file name for a ks0108 panel
  * would be: "ks0108_Panel.h"
  * The ks0108 pin configuration file for a "Arduino" board would be: "ks0108_Arduino.h"
  * and the pin configuration file for a "Mega": "ks0108_Mega.h"

/***********************************************************************************************************
 *
 * BETA TEST NOTE:
 *  - Does the autoconfig work correctly in your environment with your boards and displays?
 *  - Is the mechanism to make a custom configuration easy to use?
 *  - We want your comments and suggestions for making configuration easer, particularly for novices
 *
 * Additional "autoconfig" files can be created, there is an example for 192x64 panels in this distribution.
 * In the future there will be more for different panel types, like sed1520, ks0713, etc..
 * Not all custom configuration files that may be supplied in the release are included in the alpha distribution
